> Here are some ideas to get you started...

# RTX Autonomous Vehicle Competition
GW has participated in an autonomous drone competition since 2023-2024. Each year the competition presents a new contest for students to build one or more drones to overcome challenges. This is an **interdisciplinary project** that will span CS, ECE, and MAE. The CS team will primarily be responsible for developing the software to control the drones. GW will then take the drones to a competition to see how we perform compared to other schools. This is a great chance work on a real hardware/software project and build connections with Raytheon/RTX, a major R&D corporation for the US Government. **We are looking for ~4 students to fill this project!**

# Sign Language Communication Aid
The purpose of this project is to create a system that enables more natural/seamless communication for deaf individuals by capturing and translating sign language into text or voice. In addition, create a system for those who do not know sign language to communicate in sign language, making communication more natural and bidirectional. This is an **interdiscipinary project** with students in both ECE and CS. **We are looking for 1-2 students to join this project!**

# Underwater Robotic Systems
The project aims to develop an underwater robotic system that may be used in combating multiple environmentally important issues such as cleaning ocean’s plastic (microplastic) and/or Lionfish detainment. Invasive lionfish threaten native fish and the environment in U.S. Atlantic coastal waters. Invasive species are capable of causing extinctions of native plants and animals, reducing biodiversity, competing with native organisms for limited resources, and altering habitats (Lionfish link). Plastic debris injures and kills fish, seabirds and marine mammals. These plastic polymers directly pose a great threat to marine organisms and also indirectly affect the ecosystem by adsorbing other marine pollutants (link 1, link 2). Eventually, people’s health is at risk as the consumer of these sea animals. The project will seek to build an underwater robot capable of identifying problems such as these. This is an **interdiscipinary project** with students in both ECE and CS. **We are looking for 1-2 students to join this project!**

# Distraction Free Commuting Productivity/Entertainment
Create an application to make my hour long commute more productive or fun. The application should be designed for someone driving a car so it must be entirely audio based and be designed to limit distractions while still giving the driver something entertaining/useful to do.

# Healthcare Data Analytics Platform
Develop an algorithm for analyzing medical data to predict disease outcomes or suggest personalized treatments. Implement a web-based application that securely processes and visualizes patient data, taking into consideration data privacy and security measures.

# Traffic Optimization System
Design an algorithm to optimize traffic flow in a city based on real-time data from various sources. Develop a software solution that integrates with traffic lights, cameras, and other infrastructure to implement the algorithm and manage traffic patterns.

# Financial Portfolio Management Tool
Create an algorithm that optimizes investment portfolio allocations based on risk tolerance and market trends. Build a web or mobile application that allows users to manage their portfolios, leveraging the algorithmic insights.

# UTA/LA Scheduler
Every year the CS department has to assign ~50 students as undergraduate Learning and Teaching Assistants. This is a complex scheduling process that is currently done manuarlly (by your poor instructor). This project would build an automated system that accepts information about classes and student/faculty preferences to determine the best matching. If you do a good job, this could be adopted by the CS department!

# Encrypted & Sharded Cloud Storage System
Build a system that allows me to provide multiple cloud storage platform credentials and will act as a single “cloud”. When I upload files, they should be encrypted and chunked, with each piece stored in a separate cloud provider. When I download files, these encrypted chunks should be joined together and unencrypted on disk. Provide a UI that allows me view an index of my files & supports uploads/downloads. This solution should take security into account.

# Network Threat Detector
Design a platform capable of performing high speed analysis of network traffic to detect security threats. This could involve designing and deploying ML classification algorithms to specialized hardware like programmable network cards or switches in Prof. Wood's lab.

# Public Speaking Trainer
Design a tool to help people improve their speaking skills. Your system might include automated video and audio analysis of a recorded presentation to score the speaker on their volume, posture, use of filler words, etc. The system would then give feedback to help people improve their slides and presentation delivery.

# AI Memory Bank
Build a tool that helps gather information from a user's daily life and allow it to be queried to act as a second memory. For example, you might gather audio or transcripts from a zoom meeting and then provide the user with a context-aware summary when they meet with the same people at a later time. The system would focus on both gathering the information which is worth persisting and allowing it to be queried against using techniques like Large Language Models.

# Private LLM Box
Large language models and generative AI can provide value to many businesses by helping them understand their own data, but current systems require them to share that data in ways that may violate their security or privacy policies. This project will seek to build a domain-specific LLM processing device that businesses could deploy on their own premise that guarantees all processing is done locally. For example, you could build a health-care specific platform that includes a mix of hardware (such as a mini PC with powerful graphics card in a pretty box) and software for storing patient data and loading it into powerful ML models for analysis by doctors. 

# AI-Powered Rental Platform for College Students
Develop an AI-driven platform that streamlines the process of finding rental properties for college students. The platform allows students to search for rentals based on proximity to their college, budget, and specific preferences. It also assists landlords in finding suitable tenants by matching their properties with students' needs. The project employs machine learning algorithms to recommend optimal listings, incorporating real-time data on rental prices and availability. The platform aims to simplify the housing search process for students and enhance property management for landlords.

# AI-Powered Wearable Health System for College Students
Project Description: Develop an AI-driven health monitoring system that integrates with wearable devices like smartphones and Apple Watches to track college students' sleep, diet, exercise, and other health-related activities. The system analyzes the collected data and provides personalized health recommendations based on the latest scientific research in health and wellness. By connecting the system to evidence-based studies, it offers suggestions that are not only personalized but also grounded in proven health outcomes. The project aims to improve students' well-being and academic performance through scientifically backed health management, offering actionable insights on a weekly or monthly basis.
